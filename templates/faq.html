<h3>How can this website help?</h3>


<p>We know that a lot of things we eat can cause tooth decay; however, we also know that we can brush our teeth regularly to prevent cavities. The risk of depression works the same way. Because depression develops in the brain, there are things you can do to help protect your brain. Depression involves negative thinking about yourself and others. Project CURB can help teach you how to pay attention to how you are thinking and acting and, in some cases, how to change those patterns.&nbsp;<strong>This does not involve taking any medications.</strong>&nbsp;The goal of this project is to try to prevent depression and keep you on track for a healthy adulthood. We believe in supporting your natural ability to change how you act.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>What do I have to do?</h3>
<p>This site has 14 modules. Each module will take about 15 to 20 minutes to complete and includes about 20 pages of learning material with 2-3 pages of &ldquo;skill builders.&rdquo; The skill builders help you learn more about yourself and apply what you learned. We recommend doing a skill builder about every 2 or 3 days to give yourself a chance to think about what you've learned and practice it. Just like an athlete has to keep in shape through regular workouts, you have to keep your brain in shape by completing the skill builders.<br /><br />We also ask that you not drink alcohol or use illegal drugs while you're participating in Project CURB. As we've said, the CURB program is a type of training, like going through a workout regimen; you won't be able to do your best on the CURB study if you have to deal with the problems that illegal drugs and alcohol can cause. Drugs and alcohol can make depression much worse and can certainly keep you from reaching your goals. If you&rsquo;re struggling to quit using drugs or alcohol, we recommend that you talk with your doctor so they can help you find safe ways to quit.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>

<h3>Will other people find out?</h3>
<p>You can keep the content of your exercises private. We don&rsquo;t collect any information from you and all of your responses to the feedback questions are completely anonymous.&nbsp; Only a few of the screens will have words like &ldquo;depression&rdquo; in large enough type to be seen by another person.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>What if I do not want my friends or family to know?</h3>
<p>This is a website from which any person may benefit. The situations and problems we discuss happen to almost all teenagers and young adults. You may discover that some of your friends have used self-help books or have been in counseling for similar problems. What you tell your friends and family is up to you, but you may find it helpful to discuss what you're learning with the people you love. One of the advantages of this approach is that you can work on this website yourself and maintain your privacy or you can share it with others. It's entirely your choice.<br /><br/></p>

<h3>What will my family think?</h3>
<p>Only you can answer this. If you are experiencing depression, the chances are that someone else in your family may have already experienced this problem, too. Your parents and brothers and sisters may have already noticed changes in your behavior and are concerned about you. They will most likely be relieved that you are getting help. Most teens in our last study stated their family wanted them to do the program.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>I'm afraid to tell other people about CURB-what should I do?</h3>
<p>Sometimes it is better to keep things to yourself. Some of the things you learn about your feelings are just for you. Some people can take advantage of you when they know your feelings. So it's OK to think twice before you share things with others. Let yourself get a bit stronger before you tell others what you are doing or how you are feeling.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>Will my school or employer find out?</h3>
<p>No. This information is entirely private. However, what is taught on this website is similar to what is found in many employer- or school-sponsored stress management programs. You are not doing anything unusual or strange. Many schools and employers actually encourage their students and employees to participate in programs that help people deal with life's problems.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>What about prayer and faith?</h3>
<p>Many people believe that prayer and faith are their most important defenses against depression and other problems. Prayer can be a great source of strength. While this website provides methods for people to help themselves by taking charge of their own behavior, it is only one way of preventing a medical problem. This website is not intended as a replacement for any religious belief.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>My pastor might think I'm supposed to use prayer and God to get over things-what about that?</h3>
<p>CURB encourages you to participate in religious life and activities. The program is about building strength so you can go out into the world and care for yourself and others. It makes sense to practice your faith, and this can include reading Holy Scriptures, praying, going to church, and joining youth groups at church (see Section K, &ldquo;Sources&rdquo; for more information). Teens who do these things actually tend to be less likely to be depressed, and CURB helps give you some coping skills you can use to help yourself and others.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re worried about CURB going against your own religious beliefs, feel free to talk to a religious leader about it and see what they think.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>Will this website make me feel bad?</h3>
<p>Much of what we hope to teach you is how to recognize your emotions and how your thoughts and actions affect those emotions. During this training program you may occasionally have what might be called &ldquo;ah-ha moments&rdquo;; you may come to understand how someone or something-even something you did-really hurt you. You may feel uncomfortable for a little while, but most people feel a sense of relief knowing what bothers them and what they can do to change it. As with training for sports, school, or work, sometimes you have to put up with a bit of pain to move ahead in your life. However, if this website does cause bad feelings that don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re going away, you may want to talk with a doctor or other trusted adult who can help you.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>What if I feel like my feelings are out of control?</h3>
<p>If at any time you feel overwhelmed or are concerned in any way, you can always contact your own doctor, call a help line like 800-273-TALK, teen line like 800-852-8336, or find another professional to talk to.&nbsp; If CURB feels like it&rsquo;s bringing up too many hard feelings, we suggest you stop using it until you have spoken to someone you trust who can support you.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>Can my behavior change the way my brain works?</h3>
<p>Many of you may have thought that only a medication can change chemical imbalances in a person's brain. The beauty of the brain is that it's always learning-particularly when you are young. This is called &ldquo;neuro-plasticity,&rdquo; which means that when you change your behavior you actually change the way your brain works.&nbsp;<strong>By changing the behaviors you want to change, you can change yourself.</strong><br /><br /></p>

<h3>Is this hard to do?</h3>
<p>Anyone who has tried to stop an unwanted habit can tell you it takes time and motivation. It's like going to the gym to get in shape or trying to quit smoking. Seeing how some things you do can make you feel badly might make you sad or anxious, but there are alternatives to feeling that way. We stick with you and help through those sad or anxious moments. If you stick with it, Project CURB will teach you how to manage your moods to feel better. Click on the &ldquo;I am feeling &hellip;&rdquo; tab on the right so we can help you out.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>Has this program worked for other people my age?</h3>
<p>In our pilot study, those who finished the program experienced a decline in their depressed moods and in other risk factors for depression. Because we haven't done a full trial study with a comparison group, we don't know yet how much benefit the program will have for a specific individual.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>What do people have to say about the program?</h3>
<p>Below are some comments from people who have finished the program:<br />&ldquo;Really good at explaining why change affects people so they feel sad.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I liked the emphasis on personal responsibility and continually changing oneself.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Good ideas to bring it all together. I like the concept of resiliency.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;The emphasis on healthy communication in situations of anger is very good.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I liked the relationship issue information-really resonated with me.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;It was clear and made me really consider how negative thoughts have impacted my life.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I liked the part on the negative self-criticism as a bar to future growth-it struck a chord with me.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p>

<h3>What is Project CURB really about?</h3>
<p>It's actually untrue to say that Project CURB is just about depression. In fact, this program is about something that can affect your entire life whether or not you're depressed. It's about who you want to be and what you want to do. Depression can affect more than just your thoughts and feelings; it affects your body, motivation, and relationships. As you'll see, your mood is deeply connected to the sorts of challenges you meet, the problems you solve, and the skills you learn as a part of growing up and achieving your goals.<br/><br/></p>

<h3>How was CURB developed?</h3>
<p>CURB was developed by leading universities to improve teen coping skills. The program was originally developed by Dr. Benjamin W. Van Voorhees while he was a doctor in training at Johns Hopkins University and later, the program was developed further at the University of Chicago. Dr. Karen Taylor-Crawford has led the effort to adapt the original program to URBAN youth. The program you are working on is the result of collaboration between Miles Square Clinics, Corazon Community Services, Family Services of Cicero, and University of Illinois, Chicago.</p>
