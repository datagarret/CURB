<p>
    <strong>Speaking directly works</strong>
    <br/>
    The talking style most likely to solve problems and build strong
    relationships is the calm, cool, and direct approach. This means listening
    to what the other person has said, and then clearly and directly telling
    the person how you feel and what you want. You can walk away knowing that
    you said what you (and probably the other person, too) needed to say. You
    are unlikely to stay angry. The other person will feel better about working
    things out with you.

<p>
    <strong>Speaking calmly works</strong>
    <br/>
    Even if you're upset, it's better to hold your temper back a bit. You want
    the other person to hear you. He or she is more likely to listen to you
    when you're not so angry. Being hostile makes it hard for other people to
    listen to what you have to say. Think of when a microphone or a radio has
    static-it interferes with the words and sounds. Intense emotions that are
    accusatory and angry are like static that keeps you from being heard.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Speaking cooly works</strong>
    <br/>
    This means definitely telling the other person what's bothering you and
    what hurt your feelings. When you state your case, you should tell him or
    her how you see it. However, don't make accusations and try not to be
    angry.
