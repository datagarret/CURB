    <strong>What “cycle” are you talking about?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This cycle is the rhythm of life. It shows up in our different habits,
    customs, and patterns of living. We often think that having habits is
    somehow bad-that it means that we're boring or in a rut-but in fact, many
    habits and rhythms of living add meaning, stability, and happiness to our
    lives.
