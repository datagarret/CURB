    <strong>Wrap-up</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Our actions are affected by how we think about things. Our thoughts depend
    on often unrealistic thoughts because we decide what we want to see. Like a
    virus, unrealistic negative thoughts can fill our head and shape our life.
    To fight against negative thoughts, we use counter-thoughts that act like
    medicine for your mind.
