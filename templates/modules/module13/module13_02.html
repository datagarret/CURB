    your point of view. Think about the following questions for a minute. Feel
    free to write down some of your thoughts!

    </li>

    </li>
    <li>
        How do you think that coping skill might work in real life to keep you

    </li>
    <li>
        What motivated you to want to use that coping skill since that last
