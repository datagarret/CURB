    <strong>How do I make a decision about seeking treatment?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We suggest you discuss your concerns with your doctor or another trusted
    adult before your depression becomes too severe. You can develop a plan of
    monitoring and self-care if you decide you aren't ready to be treated.
    Getting a professional evaluation will add an important viewpoint to your
    decision about treatment.
