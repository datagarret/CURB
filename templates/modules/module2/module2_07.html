    The next two modules (Modules 2 and 3) outline the theory behind BA and the
    techniques it offers.
</p>
<p>
    In Module 3, you can learn about the ways your actions and behaviors and
    your mood are all connected to each other, and you can learn how to realize
    ways in which your habits might cause a cycle of depression.
</p>
<p>
    Module 4 shows how to avoid this cycle, and how you can build new habits to
    improve your mood and enrich your life.

        its best advantage and improve the way you live your life.
