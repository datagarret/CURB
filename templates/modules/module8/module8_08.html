    Sometimes you cannot avoid a situation physically (for example, an
    important test), but the negative thoughts can make it harder to prepare
    for it. In order to avoid your negative thoughts, you can control how you
    respond to the situation mentally. Sometimes the best way to deal with
    repetitive negative thoughts is simply to <strong>stop them</strong>. Here
    are some techniques to help you stop your negative thoughts. You can choose
    which technique would work best for you.
