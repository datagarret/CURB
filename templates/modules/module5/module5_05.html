    You must motivate yourself to give your best effort. Just like athletes
    develop muscle pain after a hard workout, you may occasionally have some
    uncomfortable feelings when you do these exercises, or be upset or sad
    about the things you learn about yourself. A little discomfort is part of
    the process, and will eventually make you stronger.
