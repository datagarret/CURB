            <p>
                Sha'Niece takes some time to think about what she likes and is interested in doing. She decides that hair styling is her passion. With that, she ventures to the GED program facility's library before leaving for the day to find resources on her career choice.

            <p>
                At the library, Sha'Niece asks a woman who works there for help on how to get her hair license. The librarian is an older woman, who kindly takes the time to show Sha'Niece all the ways she can find information on cosmetology. The librarian, Mrs. Brown, also congratulates Sha'Niece on her work toward a GED and on her baby soon to be born. Sha'Niece finds that the librarian's helpfulness and similar interest are encouraging and uplifting.

                After a few days at the library, Sha'Niece and Mrs. Brown seem to get along well. Sha'Niece feels that Mrs. Brown treats her like a daughter and this makes her feel like a small void in her life is being filled!

             <p>
           Jamal's mother decides to let him attend the summer program! Ms. Jenkins sets him up to tutor younger students at a nearby grade school so that Jamal can earn some money while still participating in the math program. His mother was happy about that, and Jamal felt good that she was at ease about what he would be doing this summer. He begins tutoring before and after math class and thinks that this schedule could actually work out really well. This attitude helps Jamal sleep better and he feels an overall sense of pride throughout his days.

                <p class="lead">Ivan</p>
                 At first, Ivan was having a great time hanging out more with his girlfriend, her brother and some of the guys from the break dance crew. In fact, he was having so much fun that he actually started to skip a couple of shifts at the restaurant. When he told the guys that he got into trouble with his boss, they suggested that he come smoke weed with them so that he can learn to &#8220;relax.&#8221; The first time he tried it he didn't really enjoy it, but he keeps doing it because he feels like if he doesn't, he'll lose his friends that he finally feels like he can regularly chill with.
               <p/>
               <p>
           One of Ivan's teachers pulled him aside and let him know that his grades had drastically dropped after he had started skipping school and had gotten bad grades on a couple of exams. He felt really worried at first but then thought, &#8220;Who cares.&#8221; He knows his parents won't find out as they are too busy worrying about other things, and they don't care if he goes to college anyway. As long as he makes most of his shifts at work, he can keep hanging out with his friends. Ivan feels school doesn't matter too much anyway.

                <p class="lead">Danny</p>
            <p>
                Although he felt better after talking with his advisor, Danny quickly became overwhelmed by school again and started feeling hopeless about his entire future. He had always done really well in school and he couldn't understand why it was so difficult for him now. He started to think that maybe he just wasn't smart enough and that maybe college wasn't for him.
            </p>
            <p>
          Danny knows his parents will be disappointed if he doesn't finish school and the thought of disappointing them makes him feel even worse. Danny also feels frustrated because it seems like he is the only one who is having such hard time. His friends still go out every weekend and spend most of their afternoons watching TV. This makes Danny even more certain that there must be something wrong with him because everyone else seems to manage just fine. Feeling frustrated and upset makes it even harder for Danny to concentrate on his work.

            <p class="lead">Elena</p>
            <p>
                Sitting in school the day before felt like a dream. The good feelings Elena got being with her friend and her sister slowly faded away as Jose possessively kept his eyes, and hands, on her all day long. Jose mentioned that he's noticed her trying to &#8220;break free&#8221; of him and that there was no way he would let that happen. Elena felt like she could physically feel the strength she got from her sister and her friend falling away from her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Who was I kidding, she thought. I'm stuck with these gang bangers&#8230;even if I decide to break up with Jose. It felt like all of the stupid things she had done recently flooded into her mind in an instant.
            </p>
           <p>
               Elena could see her old friend Carla smiling down the hallway walking toward her, but Elena couldn't bear the thought of facing her in this weak state. Feeling anxious again, Elena decided to cut class for the rest of the day.
